# 👨‍💻 Welcome to **Team C242-PS356**! 🚀

## 🌾 **PadiCare: Smart Agri-Fishery Solution**
We are a diverse team working on **PadiCare**, an AI-powered mobile app designed to assist Indonesian rice farmers by diagnosing plant diseases and providing actionable treatment recommendations. This project integrates machine learning, mobile development, and cloud computing to provide accessible solutions for sustainable agriculture. 🌱

## 🤝 **Meet the Team:**
Our team consists of brilliant minds from different universities, each bringing unique skills to the table:

  - Aziz Rahmad Isnanto (Universitas Prasetiya Mulya) - [Active] 📲

## 📑 **Project Overview**:
**PadiCare** is aimed at improving rice farming practices in Indonesia by addressing the challenges of plant health monitoring. Currently, rice farmers lose 30-40% of their annual yield due to plant diseases, but only 12% have access to advanced agricultural technology. We aim to bridge this gap using AI-powered image recognition for disease diagnosis. 🌾💡

### 📝 **Executive Summary:**
Rice farmers face massive challenges with plant diseases like bacterial leaf blight and rice blast, causing up to 80% yield reduction. PadiCare aims to change this by providing an AI-based mobile app that diagnoses plant health through image recognition and offers real-time treatment suggestions. With a user-friendly design and offline capabilities, PadiCare empowers farmers to mitigate crop losses and boost yields. 📱🌱

## 💡 **Challenges & Risks**:
- **Limited Dataset**: The accuracy of disease detection might be affected by the size of the dataset.
- **Computational Resources**: We need hardware with sufficient computational speed to process large amounts of image data.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: We require support in developing and scaling cloud infrastructure for model deployment and storage. ☁️⚙️

## 🧠 **Areas We Need Support**:
- Guidance in improving our ML model for better accuracy
- Assistance with cloud infrastructure and API development
- Mentorship from experts in AI and cloud computing to help us scale our solution 🌟

## 🎯 **Our Goal**:
We are committed to leveraging AI to address pressing agricultural issues in Indonesia. By creating a scalable, AI-powered solution, we hope to make a real impact on the lives of rice farmers, improve agricultural productivity, and contribute to sustainable farming practices. 🌾🤖
